ITunes Web Mini-Remote
======================

Minimal ITunes Web Remote control based on rb-appscript (OS X only) and sinatra. Just a quick port
of http://rubyforge.org/projects/itunes-frontend to rb-appscript.

It is a GEM!
============

It depends on the 'rb-appscript' and 'sinatra' gems so make sure you got those before you start.

Testing directly from the repository:
  cd bin; RUBYLIB=../lib ./start-itunes-web-mini-remote

Building the .gem file using the following command:
  gem build itunes-web-mini-remote.gemspec'
